Landing page that shows a sign up page as well as a log in link in the nav bar for existing users. 
Once a user is logged in they will be taken to a page where they can view their own profile. From this page there are links to check their friend list as well as make a post. 

### What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch goals?
Ability to share posts to other social media platforms such as Facebook(our main competitor), Twitter and LinkedIn. Ability for multiple users to sign up and interact with eachother so that we do not have to rely solely on fake friends generated by the API. Add access feature so that user's page can only be accessed once you are friends with the individual. Implement remember user feature so that users don't have to type log in info every time. Use flask mail add-on so that after creating an account, an email gets sent to the user's email to verify and confirm registration.
